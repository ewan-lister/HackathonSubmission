This project is designed to test if an entire string of bits are all 1. 
This is a test that can be scaled and leveraged in data analysis softwares, especially those that deal with large quantities of data.
For example, a 1 could represent every stock price that increased over the course of a trading day.
The code is set up in a way that should be intelligible, especially if you have understood the alternating bit sequence example solution.
